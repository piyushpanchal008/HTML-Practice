# SEVEN (07) WONDER OF WORLD</center></font></h2></p><br>
<p><font size=5>In 2000 a Swiss foundation launched a campaign to determine the New Seven Wonders of the<br>
World. Given that the original Seven Wonders list was compiled in the 2nd century BCE—and<br> 
that only one entrant is still standing (the Pyramids of Giza)—it seemed time for an update.<br> 
And people around the world apparently agreed, as more than 100 million votes were cast on<br> 
the Internet or by text messaging. The final results, which were announced in 2007, were met<br>
 with cheers as well as some jeers—a number of prominent contenders, such as Athens’s<br> 
Acropolis, failed to make the cut. Do you agree with the new list?<br></font>
